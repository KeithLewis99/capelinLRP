## data


a = age (2:4; not age 0 or 1)
t = time (year from start of spring acoustic survey)
s = survey (not currently used as only spring acoustic survey is part of the model)

Barents Sea
BS8 Revision of the basis for capelin Blim.pdf; Table 1, pg 5.

"Capelin survey mortality from age 2 (immatures) to age 3 by cohort. Z is calculated as -log(N age 3 in year y+1/N imm age 2 in year y). M is calculated as -log((N age 3 in year y+1) + (catch immatures age 3 in year y+1 and age 2 in year y)/(N imm age 2 in year y))."

$$
Z = -ln(N_{3,t+1}/Ni_{2,t}) \\
M = -ln((N_{3,t+1})+ (CAA_{i3,t+1} + CAA_{i2,t})/(Ni_{2,t})) What's in the BS document \\ 
M = -ln((N_{3,t+1}+ CAA_{3,t+1} + CAA_{2,t})/Ni_{2,t}) What I did
$$

Note that I already have N is natural log so i'd need to take the e^N and then take the log again

$$
Z = -ln(exp(N_{3,t+1})/exp(Ni_{2,t})) \\
M = -ln((exp(N_{3,t+1})) + (CAA_{i3,t+1} + CAA_{i2,t})/exp(Ni_{2,t}))
$$
